IDEAS
=====

- Check if damages actually improve perf
- controller is another process so can be restarted w/o losing sessions
- If control written in go, shared memory??
- Edit mode delegated to a command. Works on any text, a la fzy.
  Allows selecting location like surfingkeys, selection by regex, eg
  url.
