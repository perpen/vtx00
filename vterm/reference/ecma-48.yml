  :summary: PARALLEL TEX TS
  :description: |-
    PTX is used to delimit strings of graphic characters that are communicated one after another in the data
    stream but that are intended to be presented in parallel with one another, usually in adjacent lines.
    The parameter values are
    0 end of parallel texts
    1 beginning of a string of principal parallel text
    2 beginning of a string of supplementary parallel text
    3 beginning of a string of supplementary Japanese phonetic annotation
    4 beginning of a string of supplementary Chinese phonetic annotation
    5 end of a string of supplementary phonetic annotations
    PTX with a parameter value of 1 indicates the beginning of the string of principal text intended to be
    presented in parallel with one or more strings of supplementary text.
    PTX with a parameter value of 2, 3 or 4 indicates the beginning of a string of supplementary text that is
    intended to be presented in parallel with either a string of principal text or the immediately preceding
    string of supplementary text, if an y; at the same time it indicates the end of the preceding string of
    principal text or of the immediately preceding string of supplementary text , if any. The end of a string of
    supplementary text is indicated by a subsequent occurrence of PTX with a parameter value other than 1.
    PTX with a parameter value of 0 indicates the end of the strings of text intended to be presented in
    parallel with one another.
    NOTE
    PTX does not explicitly specify the relative placement of the strings of principal and supplementary
    parallel t exts, or the relative si zes of graphic characters in the strings of parallel text. A string of
    supplementary text is normally presented in a line adjacent to the line containing the string of principal
    text, or adjacent to the line cont aining the immediately preceding string of supplementary text, if any.
    The first graphic character of the string of principal text and the first graphic character of a string of
    supplementary text are normally presented in the same position of their respective lines. However, a
    string of supplementary text longer (when presented) than the associated string of principal text may be
    centred on that string. In the case of long strings of text, such as paragraphs in different languages, the
    strings may be presented in successive lines in parallel columns, with their beginnings aligned with one
    another and the shorter of the paragraphs followed by an appropriate amount of "white space".
    Japanese phonetic annotation typically consists of a few hal f-size or smal ler K ana characters which
    indicate the pronunciation or interpretation of one or more Kanji characters and are presented above
    those Kanji characters if the character path is horizontal, or to the right of them if the character path is
    vertical.
    Chinese phonetic annotation typically consists of a f ew Pinyin characters which indicate the
    pronunciation of one or more Hanzi characters and are presented above those Hanzi characters.
    Alternatively, the Pinyin characters may be presented in the same line as the Hanzi characters and
    following the respective Ha nzi characters. The Pinyin characters will then be presented within enclosing
    pairs of parentheses.

    Every beginning of such a string invokes the next deeper level of nesting.
    This Standard does not define the location of the active data position within any such nested string.
    The end of a di rected string is indicated by SDS with a parameter value of 0. Every end of such a string
    re-establishes the next higher level of nesting (the one in effect prior to the string just ended). The
    direction is re-established to that in effect prior to the string just ended. The active data position is
    moved to the character position following the characters of the string just ended.

  :summary: SET TRANSMIT STATE
  :description: |-
    STS is used to establish the transmit state in the receiving device. In this state the transmission of data
    from the device is possible.
    The actual initiation of transmission of data is performed by a data communication or input/output
    interface control procedure which is out side the scope of this Standard.
    The transmit state is established either by STS appearing in the received data stream or by the operation
    of an appropriate key on a keyboard.

    SU causes the data in the presentation component to be moved by n line positions if the line orientation

    move up; where n equals the value of Pn.
    The active presentation position is not affected by this control function.

    TAC causes a character tabulation stop calling for centring to be set at character position n in theactive
    line (the line that contains the active presentation position) and lines of subsequent text in the
    presentation component, where n equals the value of Pn. TAC causes the replacem ent of any tabulation
    stop previously set at that character position, but does not affect other tabulation stops.
    A text string centred upon a tabulation stop set by TAC will be positioned so that the (trailing edge of
    the) first graphic character and the(leading edge of the) last graphic character are at approximately equal
    distances from the tabulation stop.

    2 all character tabulation stops in the active line are cleared
    3 all character tabulation stops are cleared

TCC:

  :summary: TABULATION CENTRED ON CHARACTER
  :description: |-
    TCC causes a character tabulation stop calling for alignment of a target graphic character to be set at
    character position n in the active line (the line that contains the active presentation position) and lines of
    subsequent text in the presentation component, where n equals the value of Pn1, and the target character
    about which centring is to be performed is specified by Pn2. TCC causes the replacem ent of any
    tabulation stop previously set at that character position, but does not affect other tabulation stops.
    The positioning of a text string aligned with a tabulation stop set by TCC will be determined by the first
    occurrence in the string of the target graphic character; that character will be centred upon the tabulation
    stop. If the target character does not occur with in the string, then the trailing edge of the first character
    of the string will be positioned at the tabulation stop.
    The value of Pn2 indicates the code table position (binary value) of the target character in the currently
    invoked code. For a 7-bit code, the perm issible range of values is 32 to 127; for an 8-bit code, the
    permissible range of values is 32 to 127 and 160 to 255.
